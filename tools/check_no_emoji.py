"""Fail if any git-tracked text file contains a disallowed emoji.

Policy (user, 2026-06-20): emoji are a FAILURE STATE. The only permitted pictographic/symbol
glyphs are the Susan-Kare icon set (`~/projects/scripts/_stylerc`) plus the plain typographic
arrows used as text operators:

    →  U+2192  (ICON_START)        ✓  U+2713  (ICON_OK)
    ✗  U+2717  (ICON_ERR)          ⚠  U+26A0  (ICON_WARN)
    ↔  U+2194  ↑  U+2191  ↓  U+2193 (typographic arrows — permitted as text)

Everything else in the emoji/symbol ranges below (check-mark-button, colour squares, the warn sign
with an emoji variation-selector, decorative section emoji, double-arrow / star, keycaps, regional
flags, ...) is rejected. This is a deterministic, app-free style gate, run by `ci_local.sh` and the
pre-commit hook so the policy can't silently regress.

    python3 tools/check_no_emoji.py            # all tracked text files (ci_local.sh gate)
    python3 tools/check_no_emoji.py --staged   # only staged files (pre-commit hook)

This file lists disallowed codepoints by NUMBER, never as literal glyphs, so it never trips itself.

#   1. Kare icon set + approved typographic arrows — the canonical vocabulary.
#   2. Functional (non-emoji) symbols that carry meaning, not decoration: Mac modifier-key glyphs
#      shown in native menus / shortcut docs, and the left-arrow companion to the cardinal set.
